## âœ… Summary: How We Improved the CNN Pipeline

---

### ðŸ”§ 1. **Model Architecture Enhancements**

#### âœ¨ What We Changed:

* Added a **third convolutional layer**
* Introduced **Batch Normalization** after each conv layer
* Retained **Dropout** and `ReLU + MaxPool` after each conv block

#### ðŸ§  Why:

* **More depth** allows the CNN to learn richer hierarchical features
* **BatchNorm** stabilizes and speeds up training by normalizing activations
* This makes the network more expressive and resilient to overfitting

---

### ðŸ”§ 2. **Better Data Augmentation**

#### âœ¨ What We Changed:

```python
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize((64, 64)),
    transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
    transforms.RandomRotation(10),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize([0.5]*3, [0.5]*3)
])
```

#### ðŸ§  Why:

* Introduces **visual variety** to each training epoch
* Helps CNN generalize by learning features invariant to flips and slight rotations
* **Essential** when the dataset isnâ€™t massive

---

### ðŸ”§ 3. **Extended Epochs for Training**

#### âœ¨ What We Changed:

```python
for epoch in range(5):  â†’  for epoch in range(20)
```

#### ðŸ§  Why:

* CNNs typically require **10â€“50+ epochs** to converge
* MLPs can get away with fewer epochs since they're fed engineered features
* You want to give the CNN enough time to optimize its filters

---

### ðŸ”§ 4. **Early Exit for Bad Configs**

#### âœ¨ What We Added:

```python
if len(fold_scores) == 1 and acc < 0.25:
    print(...)  # Skip this config early
    break
```

#### ðŸ§  Why:

* Speeds up experimentation by **skipping low-performing parameter combos**
* Prevents wasting time on configurations clearly underperforming after one fold

---

### ðŸ”§ 5. **Model Renaming**

#### âœ¨ What We Changed:

* Renamed the model from `SimpleCNN` to `ImprovedCNN`

#### ðŸ§  Why:

* Reflects the significant upgrades in design and makes the code easier to track

---

## ðŸ“ˆ The Goal of All These Changes:

To build a **CNN model that can compete with or beat your strong MLP baseline** by:

* Letting the model learn image features directly (not rely on precomputed ones)
* Making training more robust and efficient
* Preventing wasted compute on unpromising experiments
